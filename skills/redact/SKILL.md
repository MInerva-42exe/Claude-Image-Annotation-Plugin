name: redact
description: Privacy redaction — pixelate (default), blur, or solid-fill rectangular regions of an image to hide sensitive content (faces, names, tokens, IPs, PII). Originals are never modified; output goes to <input_dir>/redacted/<stem>_redacted<ext>. EXIF is stripped on output.
---

# Redact

Hide sensitive regions of an image. Use this rather than `annotate` when the goal is privacy — defaults are tuned to make the redaction non-recoverable.

## Originals-clean rule

This skill **never overwrites the original**. Output goes to `<input_dir>/redacted/<stem>_redacted<ext>` by default, or to `--output PATH` if supplied. There is no in-place mode for redaction — keep the source intact (or delete it yourself once you've verified the redacted copy).

## Just run the script

```bash
bash "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/redact.sh" \
  --input  "$INPUT" \
  [--output "$OUTPUT"] \
  [--method pixelate|blur|solid] \
  --region X,Y,W,H [--region X,Y,W,H ...]
```

## Why pixelate by default

Gaussian blur on text is reversible with deconvolution; coarse pixelation isn't. The script picks a block size of `min(W,H)/8` (floor 16) so even a small region collapses to ≤8 cells per side.

## EXIF strip

The script appends `-strip` to the ImageMagick pipeline so GPS, original timestamp, and device metadata don't survive into the redacted output.

## Behaviour rules

- If the user asks to "blur a face/text" without coordinates, ask for the bounding box — this skill does not detect content.
- After writing, report: output path, regions redacted, method per region, and a one-line reminder that the original still contains the unredacted content.
